# KMXmlParser
XML parser that in general returns result as a composition of collections: arrays and dictionaries. KMXmlParser uses libxml2 library and based on the excellent work of Matt Gallagher: http://www.cocoawithlove.com/2008/10/using-libxml2-for-parsing-and-xpath.html. Supports XPath expressions and can handle SOAP internal links specified by "id" and "href" attributes.
